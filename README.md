# House of Marley Liberate XLBT (EM-EMFH041) ear pad replacement guide

## Introduction
So, I'm in love with this earphone. I have it for 2 and a half years now and I use it every day. Of course, the ear pads have worn out, so it's time to replace it. I found replacements on both Ebay and AliExpress, so I ordered a pair. And as it turned out, no one has made a guide on how to do it, so here we go.

Yup, it definitely needs a replacement.

## Removing the old ear pads and disassembly

It's easy, you just need to pull out the old one, like this:

Now, do a favor to yourself and unscrew these two screws so you can proceed with much more comfort. I used a T6 (Torx) screwdriver for that.

There are four clips you need to loosen, which hold a plastic ring. These clips do have a specific orientation, which will be important when we assemble it back together. I just used a flat head screwdriver and pushed the plastic in the outer direction.

So, now we have the ring removed.

## Applying the new ear pad

I wasn't sure if this foam ring is necessary or not, but removing it definitely did make applying the new ear pad much more easier. If it is necessary, well, then I screwed up this part.

The new ear pad seems like a perfect (and tight) fit.

Start inserting the ring under the edge of the new ear pad. Be careful not to tear the fabric.

Make sure the fabric is not in the way of the clips on the ring.

## Putting it back together

Do a test fit and find the correct orientation of the clips (I told you it will be important). There's a sewing on the ear pad which indicates the bottom of the ear pad. If it is not aligned properly, you can rotate the ring inside the ear pod. Now the sewing should align the 3.5 Jack on the right speaker and the USB connector on the left.

Fasten the clips by pressing the ring and the speaker body together. Also, now you can screw back the body to the headband.

Now, you've made it and your earphones looks like new. Got some more years with this nice product.
